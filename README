### (Cloudformation great optimisation toolset)
It's tool allowing for describing cloudformation templates with jinja2
formating. J2 templates will be then rendered to the pure json cloudformation
templates.
This tool also allows for comparing two json files (json-diff subcommand),
creating (new) and updating (already existing) CFN stacks on AWS accounts
configured with profiles in awscli tool.

## Requirements
* python3
* docopt
* Jinja2
* MarkupSafe
* PyYAML
* awscli
* vimdiff (if json-diff is going to be used)

## Configuration
There is no configuration required for this tool at the moment at all, but one
have to have configured `awscli` with correctly set profiles to use it.

Whole configuration for CFN templates is done from yaml files which are
specified with the `--yaml-config` option

## Usage
There are 3 subcommands available:

`cfn` - for generating cloudformation templates from jinja2 files

`json-diff` - for displaying (using vimdiff) differences between 2 json files,
to make best use of it with CFN templates downloaded from AWS one have to remove
`TemplateBody` line and closing it bracket at the bottom of the file

`aws` - for updating and creating cloudformation stacks as well as validating
  them against cloudformation service provided by AWS.


Below is the exact usage:

    cfngot cfn --yaml-config <yaml_fname>
    cfngot aws (--cfn-validate|--cfn-create|--cfn-update|--cfn-destroy) --profile <profile_name> --yaml-config <yaml_fname>
    cfngot json-diff <file1> <file2>
    cfngot (-v|--version)


Example --yaml-config and jinja2 based template are in test directory within
this repository.
